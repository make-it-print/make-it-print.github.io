# Observations log
This is my printing diary where I'm going to record all interesting observations, probles, workarounds and etc.

## 2025-01-09 0.8 nozzle setup
Setup the nozzle in my printer. Copy pasted main settings from Creality Print to Orca. 

Noticed that:
1. 0.8 nozzle is set up to print much slower, i.e. around 100 mm/s, but with higher accel_to_decel
1. Filament profiles are also a bit differently configured. Flow rate is a bit higher that at the same filament but smaller nozzle.
