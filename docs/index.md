# Printing Miniatures

Miniatures require crazy precision from your printer to be able to print out all the tiny details. Pretty good looking results can be achieved by using the smallest nozzle size and layer height possible.

In this walk through I'm going to document my process of figuring out all the sttings and techniques I learned while attempting this project. So you could also do it at your own risk! :)

Here's my initial setup:
- Printer: Creality Ender3 V3 CoreXZ
- Nozzle size: 0.4mm
- Filament: Creality Hyper PLA
- Orca Slicer

Goal:
* Make it print with 0.4mm nozzle and **0.04** layer height and get the best quality possible! 
* Do the same with a smaller 0.2mm nozzle and compare results.


Now, a little sneak pick of what can be achieved:
